### Problem 1

```{r}
#birthday function for duplications.
birthday <- function(n) {
  birth <- sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)
  any(duplicated(birth))
}
```

```{r}
sizes <- 2:50
simulations <- 10000
prob <- numeric(length(sizes))

#for loop and run the function 10000 times for each group size between 2 and 50. 
for (i in seq_along(sizes)) {
  results <- replicate(simulations, birthday(sizes[i]))
  prob[i] <- mean(results)
}
```

```{r}
#plot
plot(sizes, prob, type = "b", 
     xlab = "Group Size", ylab = "Probability of Shared Birthday",
     main = "Probability",
     pch = 16, col = "blue")

```
Probability increase as group size increase.
